# Frontend Phase 2 Checkpoint Plan

This checklist defines Phase 2 (design system + layout) tasks to complete before moving to Phase 3.

---

## 1) Design System Foundation

- [x] Create tokenized typography, color, and spacing scales.
- [x] Define core semantic colors (background, surface, text, accent, success, warning, danger).
- [x] Add base typography rules and consistent focus/hover states.

## 2) UI Primitives

- [x] Build foundational components: Button, Input, Select, Textarea, Badge, Card, Skeleton, Toast.
- [x] Ensure variants for states (primary, muted, danger, success).
- [x] Apply consistent spacing and radius usage via tokens.

## 3) Layout Shell

- [x] Implement three-column shell: Library / Canvas / Inspector.
- [x] Add responsive behavior (stacked on smaller screens).
- [x] Add persistent header status area.

## 4) Style Integration

- [x] Replace ad-hoc styles in `App.jsx` with component-based styles.
- [x] Ensure no regressions to existing ops flow behavior.

## 5) Visual QA

- [x] Quick manual review in desktop + mobile widths.
- [x] Verify contrast and focus states meet accessibility minimums.
